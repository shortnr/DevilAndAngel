This folder contains Processing sketch that were used to create some of the visuals for the paper that was written in tandem with this project. There is a sketch (DevilAngelGame) that can be used to generate a game board, the bomb, the robot, and directional arrows to show move sequences. There is also a sketch (NeuralNetwork) that can generate images of neural networks (with inter-neuron connections and labels). Neither of these scripts were developed with much care and many things are manually placed (especially in the neural network sketch).
